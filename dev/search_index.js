A CCN is a 6- or 10-character alphanumeric string that encodes the provider or supplier's (respectively) State and facility type.\n\nCCNs can be constructed from AbstractString or Integer objects, but Integers can only represent a subset of all possible CCNs. For the most performant parsing of stored data, directly construct the known CCN type using constructor calls like MedicareProviderCCN(s). For slightly less performance, use ccn(T<:CCN, s) or parse(T<:CCN, s) to canonicalize the format of s and perform simple error checking. To infer what type of CCN a given value represents, use infer_ccn_type(s).\n\nCCNs inherit from AbstractString, so methods like length, get, etc. are all defined and work as if the CCN were a string identifier.\n\nCCNs are defined by CMS Manual System publication number 100-07 \"State Operations Provider Certification\".\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#CCNs.ccn-Tuple{Type{SupplierCCN}, AbstractString}","page":"Home","title":"CCNs.ccn","text":"ccn([T::Type], s) -> CCN\n\nConstruct a CCN from input s.\n\nArguments\n\nT::Type (optional) - The type of the CCN.
